<h1>Terriblog</h1>
<h2><em>The blog that's <strong>not</strong> so terrible.</em></h2>
<p>Terriblog is a simple microblog created by students as part of a web-apps project during the New York Code & Design Academy (NYCDA) Web Development Intensive course.</p>
<h2>Directions</h2>
<p>You need Ruby version 2.4.1 to run this application. After cloning this repo, open your terminal/command line and navigate to the working directory. Install the ruby gems by typing <code>bundle install</code>.</p>
<p>Open a second tab in you terminal and enter <code>ruby app.rb</code>, which will start the server. Open your browser and visit <code>localhost:4567</code> to begin using the app.</p>
<p>Open one more tab in your temrinal and type in <code>sqlite3</code> and then <code>.open blogify.db</code> to enable the database.</p>
<p>Register and you should be good to go!</p>

<p>NOTE: This project is in no way affiliated with the company Blogify. We began the project with the name BLogify and we then realized that a company by that name already existed. We then changed the name to Terriblog.</p>
